A lot of dreadful incidents have happened in the environment that we are most familiar with. While discussing the topic of our final project, we thought we could take this opportunity to answer questions regarding the school safety issues in New York City, which would be more relevant as it is where we are currently located. Some example questions would be whether the crime rate in New York City schools has gone up over the years, whether the crime rate is higher in some specific boroughs, and if a higher number of registered students indicates higher crime rates. By analyzing the dataset and utilizing data visualization techniques, we are hoping to extract meaningful information regarding the school safety issues in New York City and answers to our questions. 2.2 Data availability While searching for datasets that could provide answers to our questions, we came across a few datasets that sparked our interest on NYC Open Data. One of them is the school safety report of New York City public schools from 2010 to 2016, and the other one is the school safety report of New York City public schools from 2015 to 2016. Both datasets include information like the number of crimes for different categories, boroughs where the location is situated, number of registered students at each location, and school year, indicating that they would be sufficient for us to analyze and extract answers and information regarding school safety issues in New York City. As we are also interested in the shift in crime rates over time, we decided to go with the one that is from 2010 to 2016. The data source is [2010-2016 School Safety Report] (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-2016-School-Safety-Report/qybk-bjjc). We also found the same dataset on Kaggle. Nevertheless, since the one on NYC Open Data is considered from the original source, we chose to proceed with that one. The data is collected by the New York City Police Department (NYPD) and is published by the New York City Department of Education (DOE). Furthermore, the NYPD is responsible for maintaining the crime data for incidents that occurred among public schools in New York City, which would then be provided to the DOE for compilation, indicating that maintenance of the data is a collaborative work by the NYPD and the DOE. The update frequency of the data is annually, and the last update was on September 16, 2017, which would make sense as the data only includes information from 2010 to 2016. As DOE is the main agency that is in charge of the data, we would try to get in touch with them if we have any questions about the data. The available formats of data include CSV, CSV for Excel, TSV for Excel, RDF, RSS, and XML. To conduct our analysis and apply data visualization techniques, we could download the data in the format of CSV and call functions like read.csv( ) to read in our dataset for further analysis. While we do not find any issues with data quality, we do notice that even though the data is claimed to be school safety reports from 2010 to 2016, the data only contains the fiscal years from 2013 to 2016. Nevertheless, as there are over 6000 rows and 30 columns, we still believe we would be able to observe the change throughout the years and the dataset should be sufficient for us to conduct a holistic analysis, which is why we decide to proceed with the dataset as the above should not affect its quality. "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation There are only 36 rows have missing value, most of they miss BIN or BBL, which are not very important variable. There are 2 rows missing district code, which is an important variable in our analysis. After some investigation, I found those two are duplicates, thus I feel safe to drop those two. ## RangeA n ## 1 1-250 229 ## 2 251-500 728 ## 3 501-750 981 ## 4 751-1000 664 ## 5 1001-1250 343 ## 6 1251-1500 267 ## 7 1501-1750 104 ## 8 1751-2000 61 ## 9 2001-2500 77 ## 10 2501-3000 34 ## 11 3001-4000 45 ## 12 4000+ 13 3.3 Missing value analysis We can recover those missing value as long as those schools still exist. ## BIN BBL ## 36 36 ## Postcode Latitude ## 24 24 ## Longitude Community.Board ## 24 24 ## Council.District Census.Tract ## 24 24 ## Geographical.District.Code School.Year ## 6 0 ## Building.Code DBN ## 0 0 ## Location.Name Location.Code ## 0 0 ## Address Borough ## 0 0 ## Register Building.Name ## 0 0 ## X..Schools Schools.in.Building ## 0 0 ## Major.N Oth.N ## 0 0 ## NoCrim.N Prop.N ## 0 0 ## Vio.N ENGroupA ## 0 0 ## RangeA AvgOfMajor.N ## 0 0 ## AvgOfOth.N AvgOfNoCrim.N ## 0 0 ## AvgOfProp.N AvgOfVio.N ## 0 0 ## Borough.Name NTA ## 0 0 "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Graph 6 4.2 Graph 7 4.3 Graph 8 4.4 Graph 9 4.5 Graph 10", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Graph 6 To have a better understanding of number of crimes in each category at different geographical districts, we decided to make a Cleveland dot plot as the number of crimes is discrete data. We separated different categories of crimes by color for easier interpretation. As you can see from the graph, for most of the districts, non-criminal crime is the dominant category, followed by other crime, property crime, violent crime, and major crime, in that order respectively. From the graph, we can also learn about which districts have higher number of crimes regarding different categories. We can see that District 2, 31, and 10 have much higher number of crimes in most categories than the rest of the districts. 4.2 Graph 7 We would also like to see how number of crimes in each category changes overtime. We then decided to make time series plot to observe the change in number of crimes in each category. We used different color for different categories of crimes for easier interpretation with faceting on boroughs. The reason why we decided to faceting on boroughs instead of geographical districts is because there are over 30 districts while there are only 5 boroughs, which would make the graph less crowded. From the graph, we can see that for most of the boroughs the top category of crime is non-criminal crime, followed by other crime, property crime, violent crime, and major crime, in that order respectively. We can also observe that Brooklyn has higher number of crimes in most categories comparing to other boroughs followed by Bronx. For most categories of crimes, the number of crimes did not change much over the years. For number fo non-criminal crimes in Brooklyn and Bronx, it does seem like there is an upward trend over the years. 4.3 Graph 8 To understand the association between categories of crimes and boroughs over the years, we made a mosaic plot. The result is similar to what we expected based on the result from the previous plot. We can observe that for almost all the boroughs the top category of crime is non-criminal crime, followed by other crime, property crime, violent crime, and major crime, in that order respectively. From the graph, now we can also observe the differences in total number of crimes among the boroughs by looking at the width of each bar. Lastly, we can notice the proportions regarding different categories of crimes and total number of crimes among the boroughs did not really change much over the years. 4.4 Graph 9 As there might be different numbers of schools in each location, we thought we could also examine the underlying structure of schools among different boroughs by making bar charts to see the frequency count of the number of schools in each location over the years. As expected, we can observe that for all the boroughs, most of the locations only include one school, but it is also interesting to see that there are 10 schools at some of the locations. We can also see that the frequency count does not really change over the years, meaning that the existing locations did not have much changes and there might be limited new locations. 4.5 Graph 10 ## Importance of components: ## PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 PC5 PC6 PC7 ## Standard deviation 2.338 0.82173 0.64171 0.52793 0.28416 0.27190 0.11182 ## Proportion of Variance 0.781 0.09646 0.05883 0.03982 0.01153 0.01056 0.00179 ## Cumulative Proportion 0.781 0.87747 0.93630 0.97612 0.98765 0.99821 1.00000 ## PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 PC5 PC6 PC7 ## Major.N 0.358 -0.451 0.429 -0.535 0.024 0.291 -0.336 ## Oth.N 0.407 -0.018 -0.212 0.453 0.378 -0.158 -0.645 ## NoCrim.N 0.394 0.014 -0.499 0.039 -0.688 0.344 -0.048 ## Prop.N 0.376 0.025 0.551 0.582 -0.040 0.272 0.374 ## Vio.N 0.391 -0.287 -0.429 -0.167 0.486 0.009 0.562 ## X..Schools 0.411 0.040 0.176 -0.146 -0.316 -0.815 0.112 ## Register 0.296 0.843 0.062 -0.344 0.214 0.181 -0.018 To understand how the variables contribute to the total variance and how they are related to each other, we decided to conduct principle components analysis (PCA). We picked a few important variables to conduct the analysis, including total number of crimes for each crime categories, total number of schools, and total number of registered students for each geographical districts. From the PCA table, we can observe that the first two principal components capture around 88% of the total variance, which is relatively high. We also display the specific linear combination of variables for each principal component for additional information. We then drew a biplot for further interpretation. From the graph, we can see that total number of students is surprisingly uncorrelated with most of the other variables as we expected that higher number of students would also indicate higher number of crimes. We can also observe that total number of schools, non-criminal crimes, property crimes, and other crimes are highly positively correlated, while total number of violent crimes and major crimes are highly correlated.
