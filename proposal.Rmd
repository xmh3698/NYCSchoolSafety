## Research topic

In this project, we analyze the school safety data. The data show the number of crimes that happened in public schools. The data is collected and updated by NYPD, then published by the Department of Education. Each observation unit in the data frame in a building. The reason is well-explained by the data source, NYC Open Data. It would be interesting to investigate whether there is a correlation between school location and crime rate. Other than the location of each school. The number of each different type of crime is also collected. Besides those, the data also contains the number of registered students and the building population. It would be interesting to look at those data to find any pattern across multiple variables.

The data, “2010-2016 NYC School Safety” is collected by NYPD, published by DOE, and owned by NYC Open Data. The Data is in CSV format and downloaded from the NYC Open Data website. The data is collected from 2010 to 2016. The Data is last updated on September 16, 2017, according to the data source. Based on the type of this dataset, no more updates should be expected. An additional file is provided to explain each column's name. Overall the data source is very easy to find and the data file is in good condition. This dataset contains about six thousand rows and thirty columns. Hence, there is some potential for multivariate analysis. Since this data comes from government agencies and is downloaded from a commonly trusted website. We can assume all the information in this dataset is correct.
