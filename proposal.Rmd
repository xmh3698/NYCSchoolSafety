# Proposal

## Research topic

In this project, we analyze the school safety data. The data show the number of crimes that happened in public schools. The data is collected and updated by NYPD, then published by the Department of Education. Each observation unit in the data frame in a building. The reason is well-explained by the data source, NYC Open Data. It would be interesting to investigate whether there is a correlation between school location and crime rate. Other than the location of each school. The number of each different type of crime is also collected. Besides those, the data also contains the number of registered students and the building population. It would be interesting to look at those data to find any pattern across multiple variables.
